## Core Training Directives

### 1. High-Level Goals & Priorities

- **Primary Goal:** To balance the demands of long-distance
running, bouldering, and thru-hiking without overtraining.

- **Running Directive:** The marathon training plan is the highest
priority. All other activities must be scheduled to support it.

- **Bouldering Goal:** To consistently climb around V5-6.

- **Hiking Goal:** To build endurance for full-day hikes with a
15-20kg pack.

### 2. Injury Prevention Rules

- **IT Band Rule:** Due to a past IT band injury, the daily plan
must **never** schedule two high-intensity running days
back-to-back.

- **Lower Back Rule:** The plan should incorporate daily mobility
and core work to prevent lower back tightness.

### 3. Scheduling & Time Constraints

- **Gym Sessions:** Must be scheduled for a maximum of 60 minutes.

- **Bouldering/Running:** Can be scheduled for 90+ minutes.

- **Morning Routine:** A 20-minute mobility/yoga session should be
scheduled every morning.

### 4. Nutrition Reference

- **Typical Daily Diet:**

- **Breakfast:** Oats, yogurt, seeds, banana, eggs, greens/avocado.

- **Lunch:** Quinoa/rice, chicken, roasted veggies/kale salad.

- **Snacks:** Apples, dehydrated veggies, overnight oats,
pineapple, guava.

- **Dinner:** Vegetable soup, eggs, quinoa, ricotta/quark.

- **Post-Dinner:** Occasional smoothie (milk, banana, protein
powder, oats, honey).

- **Fueling Rule:** The AI's daily plan should remind me to
consume sufficient carbohydrates around my workouts.

- **Protein Rule:** The plan should encourage consistent protein
intake throughout the day for recovery.

### 5. Data-Driven Adaptation Directive

- The AI must be prepared to adjust its daily recommendations based on
key Garmin metrics I provide, such as Body Battery, Stress Score, and
Sleep Score.
